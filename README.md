Here are example outputs and FULL analysis (scroll all the way down to see analysis) from the following prompt given to a variety of currently frontier models (March 8th, 2024):
PROMPT:
Create a Flappy Bird game in Python. You must include these things:
1. You must use pygame.
2. The background color should be randomly chosen and is a light shade. Start with a light blue color.
3. Pressing SPACE multiple times will accelerate the bird.
4. The bird's shape should be randomly chosen as a square, circle or triangle. The color should be randomly chosen as a dark color.
5. Place on the bottom some land colored as dark brown or yellow chosen randomly.
6. Make a score shown on the top right side. Increment if you pass pipes and don't hit them.
7. Make randomly spaced pipes with enough space. Color them randomly as dark green or light brown or a dark gray shade.
8. When you lose, show the best score. Make the text inside the screen. Pressing q or Esc will quit the game. Restarting is pressing SPACE again.
The final game should be inside a markdown section in Python. Check your code for errors and fix them before the final markdown section.

Included are the resulting .py files. I've named them to make them easy to identify. For example, fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py is flappy bird, QwQ 32b, 4.25bpw, running locally. fbirdcgpt45.py is Chatgpt 4.5's attempt, and so on, and so forth. Again, this is a FIRST SHOT attempt with no followup prompting.

I took care to ensure every generation was using the best possible settings and setup. For example, the prompt for QwQ locally was:

FIRST SHOT RESULTS:

QwQ running locally
4.25bpw, 32,768 context, q6 kv cache, tabbyAPI, 40 tokens/second
QwQ spent almost 14,000 tokens on its <think> step, then produced the output. The game is functional, looks good, plays smooth. Everything seems to be well implemented.

ChatGPT O1 Pro
Implementation looks good. The bird requires more spacebar "clicks" to navigate (gravity feels stronger). Fully playable, looks great, follows directions, no apparent issues.

Claude 3.7 Extended Thinking
Looks and feels great. The bird flies in a predictable way that still gives some interesting feedback (going higher than usual if you tap space repeatedly, etc). Probably the best implementation of the group, although QwQ and O1 Pro did fine jobs.

Deepseek R1 (deepthink)
Broken. Pipes are overlapping and the game can't be played properly. I have previously seen R1 produce a functional flappy bird, so this is probably just an example of a single bad generation.

ANALYSIS OF THE TOP 3 MODELS:

(ChatGPT 4.5 analyzing the three files):
Below is a detailed comparison and contrast of the three Flappy Bird implementations you've provided (labeled for clarity):
Overview of the three implementations:

    fbirdcgpto1pro.py​

fbirdclaude37extended.py​
fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py​

Comparison Criteria:

1. Code Structure & Maintainability

    fbirdcgpto1pro.py: Clearly structured with classes (Bird and Pipe), separate methods for drawing, updating, and collision detection. It includes helper functions and constants at the beginning, enhancing readability and maintainability.
    fbirdclaude37extended.py: Good modularization with classes and methods; encapsulates game logic into a Game class, offering strong separation of concerns. Clear handling of events and updates, structured similarly to the first implementation but slightly more organized in terms of object encapsulation.
    fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py: Primarily uses global variables and procedural programming. Lacks encapsulation into classes; all logic resides in one main loop, which could lead to maintainability challenges.

Winner: fbirdclaude37extended.py (best structure and maintainability, closely followed by fbirdcgpto1pro.py).

2. Gameplay Mechanics and Physics

    fbirdcgpto1pro.py: Implements gravity and a clear flap mechanic. Gravity (0.4) and flap acceleration (6) feel balanced, and mechanics are intuitive.
    fbirdclaude37extended.py: Includes capped jump mechanics that prevent overly rapid upward acceleration, providing smoother gameplay and better control.
    fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py: Implements basic gravity and jump mechanics similar to the other two, with slightly simpler physics, though still acceptable.

Winner: fbirdclaude37extended.py (more refined jump physics due to capped upward velocity).

3. Visual Design and Customization

    fbirdcgpto1pro.py: Features randomization of bird shapes and colors, random pipe colors, and backgrounds, providing great visual diversity each game. Also randomizes the land color, enhancing visual appeal.
    fbirdclaude37extended.py: Similar to the first implementation, includes randomized colors and shapes. However, it always begins with a fixed background color and changes only after the first round, reducing immediate visual novelty.
    fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py: Also randomizes colors (background, pipes, bird shapes), similar to others, but visual randomness is simpler and has fewer color variations.

Winner: fbirdcgpto1pro.py (more consistent and immediate visual variation, slightly ahead of others).

4. User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX)

    fbirdcgpto1pro.py: Has intuitive game-over screens clearly displaying current and best scores, along with restart instructions, clean UI.
    fbirdclaude37extended.py: Similar UI elements as the first one, good readability, clearly organized score and instructions. Slightly better due to explicit "Press Q or ESC to quit" instructions directly shown on screen.
    fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py: Displays a visually appealing game-over screen with centered texts, shadow effects on scores, and clear restart instructions. The best and current scores are prominently shown.

Winner: fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py (due to more visually appealing UI, shadowed texts, and better centered elements, closely followed by fbirdclaude37extended.py).

5. Performance & Resource Efficiency

    fbirdcgpto1pro.py: Good efficiency; pipes and bird clearly managed through object updates without redundant calculations.
    fbirdclaude37extended.py: Pipes created at timed intervals (1.5 seconds), efficient object management, similarly efficient resource usage.
    fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py: Timed pipe creation every 1.2 seconds, efficient but slightly more frequent object creation could marginally impact resource usage on lower-end hardware.

Winner: Tie between fbirdcgpto1pro.py and fbirdclaude37extended.py (slightly more conservative than the third implementation).
Overall Best Implementation:

fbirdclaude37extended.py​
Reasons for choosing this implementation as best:

    Superior Structure and Maintainability: By encapsulating gameplay within a Game class and clear method separation, it’s easier to read, modify, and expand upon.
    Refined Gameplay Mechanics: The capped upward velocity in jumps prevents exaggerated upward motion, resulting in smoother gameplay.
    Balanced Visual Randomization: While initial gameplay visuals are less randomized than the first one, it quickly catches up and maintains visual variety without overwhelming the player.
    Clear UI/UX: Includes explicit instructions for restarting and quitting, enhancing overall user experience.
    Performance Efficiency: Maintains performance with a balanced pipe-generation interval.

# Comparing the Three Flappy Bird Implementations

After analyzing all three Python implementations of Flappy Bird, I can see distinct differences in their code organization, game mechanics, and visual design approaches.

## Code Organization

- **fbirdcgpto1pro.py**: Highly structured with clear sections for constants, helper functions, game objects, and main logic. Uses well-designed classes with proper encapsulation.
- **fbirdclaude37extended.py**: Organized using classes (Bird, Pipe, Game) with the Game class encapsulating the entire game state.
- **fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py**: More procedural approach with less class-based organization. Game logic flows in the main loop.

## Game Mechanics

| Feature | fbirdcgpto1pro.py | fbirdclaude37extended.py | fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Screen size | 500×600 | 400×600 | 480×800 |
| Bird flap | Fixed acceleration (-6) | Cumulative acceleration (max 2×JUMP_STRENGTH) | Fixed acceleration (-8) |
| Pipe generation | Distance-based | Time-based (1500ms) | Time-based (1200ms) |
| Gravity | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| Pipe speed | 3 | 3 | 3 |

## Visual Customization

All three implementations offer randomized visual elements:
- Random bird shapes (square, circle, triangle)
- Random color schemes
- Random background and ground colors

The third implementation (fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py) adds a shadow effect to the score display for better visibility.

## Best Implementation: fbirdcgpto1pro.py

I believe **fbirdcgpto1pro.py** is the best implementation for these reasons:

1. **Superior Code Organization**: The clear separation into constants, helpers, classes, and game logic makes the code extremely maintainable and easy to understand.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: It contains detailed comments explaining the purpose of each section and function.

3. **Best Object-Oriented Design**: The Bird and Pipe classes have clear responsibilities with proper methods for updating, drawing, and collision detection.

4. **Better Customization Balance**: The random visual elements are well-implemented without sacrificing code clarity.

5. **More Balanced Game Physics**: The gravity value (0.4) provides a slightly more forgiving gameplay experience compared to the 0.5 used in the other implementations.

6. **Distance-Based Pipe Generation**: Rather than time-based generation, pipes are added based on their position, which creates a more consistent gameplay experience regardless of possible frame rate fluctuations.

7. **Cleaner Reset Function**: The game reset functionality is well-implemented, making it easy to restart the game.

While fbirdclaude37extended.py comes close with its Game class that nicely encapsulates the entire game state, and fbirdqwq32b425bpw.py has some nice visual touches, the overall structure, documentation, and design of fbirdcgpto1pro.py make it the most professional and maintainable implementation.
